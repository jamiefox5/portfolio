  <h2>My Mission</h2><br>
  <p>As a former elementary educator, it didn’t take me long to realize that ALL children can learn.  Seems obvious to most, however I quickly discovered that HOW they learn is the key to a truly successful education. I couldn’t expect to teach all of my Second Grade students using the same method.  It was my job as the teacher, to solve the “How Do You Learn PUZZLE” one piece at a time.<br></p>

  <p>Early into my teaching career, I realized that all of my students enjoyed computer time.  Technology was very different during that time, 1991-2003. Classrooms did not have individual computers, rather we took our entire class to a separate learning environment, the computer lab. Other than recess this was the only activity that would elicit cheers from the entire group of eight year olds.  It was in the computer lab that I quickly discovered EVERY student in my class had a voice, even the “quiet” and sometimes “hard to reach” ones. I had figured out a piece to the Learning PUZZLE. <br></p>

  <p>Fast forward, 14 years and things have really changed!  Technology has continued to grow, educational software is up to date and exciting, and Coding has become the language of the future. Most classrooms now have laptops available for each student and most students have computers at home. Coding once a language that only the “most brilliant” were believed to understand and create, is now available in the classroom.  Students as young as Kindergarten are now adding this “language” to their curriculum. It is my belief that Learning to Code is one of the answers to “How Do You Learn” PUZZLE.<br></p>

  <p>Learning to code at age 50 has been something I have enjoyed doing.  While scary at first, I am excited to have added this “language” to my skill set.  It is my goal to teach as many young people as I can, this exciting “language”. Technology gives everyone a voice.  Let me teach your child or help your organization find their voice.<br>
