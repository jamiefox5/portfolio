    <p>Jamie Fox is an educator at heart, teaching and supporting children is her passion. Professionally she taught school for 16 years, and for the last 12 years has continued to touch young lives through her numerous volunteer positions at Respite Care of San Antonio, CAMP camp, and CASA. Currently, as a Court Appointed Special Advocate, Jamie is the voice for children in state care who have been removed from their family’s due to abuse or neglect.  Attending school meetings, therapy sessions, doctor appointments, and spending special one-on-one time with these children, she is able to make sure they are getting what they need and that their voice is being heard in the courtroom. </p>
